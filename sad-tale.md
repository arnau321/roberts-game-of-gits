House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

"In a world" where Ned was learning about GIT, his internet failed. Which left him out of luck, but he could be a better King.
